This experiment focuses on designing low-fidelity wireframes for a hypothetical or generic application/website. The objective is to visualize structure, layout, and navigation without focusing on colors, fonts, or final design aesthetics.

To practice structuring digital interfaces by developing wireframes that demonstrate effective layout, content hierarchy, and user flows.

---

## Aim

- To create structured wireframes for an imaginary or generic application or website.
- To emphasize layout clarity, content positioning, and user interaction flow.
- To prepare foundational design material before creating high-fidelity mockups.

---

## Use Case Ideas

You may choose any of the following concepts for this wireframe experiment:

- Food delivery app
- Online bookstore
- Personal portfolio website
- Hotel booking website
- Task management tool
- Fitness tracking app

---

## Tools

- Paper and Pencil (initial sketches)
- Figma / Adobe XD / Balsamiq (for digital wireframes)
- Miro / Whimsical (for flows or layout planning)

---

## Procedure and Steps

1. **Define the Application Type**
   - Choose a theme (e.g., blog site, e-commerce, social app).
   - Define the primary users and their goals.

2. **List Key Screens**
   Common pages include:
   - Home / Landing Page
   - Sign Up / Login
   - Dashboard / Profile
   - Product or Content Listing
   - Details / Checkout / Booking

3. **Plan the User Flow**
   - Sketch a basic navigation flow.
   - Identify how users move from screen to screen.

4. **Draw Low-Fidelity Wireframes**
   - Create rough layouts for each screen.
   - Use boxes, placeholder text, and icons to represent content.
   - Focus on layout over visuals.

5. **Create Digital Wireframes**
   - Use a tool like Figma to digitize the sketches.
   - Maintain consistency in spacing, alignment, and component placement.

6. **Get Feedback and Iterate**
   - Share with peers or mentors.
   - Incorporate suggestions for better structure or usability.

## Learning Outcomes

- Develop a clear understanding of layout structure and page elements.
- Practice transforming ideas into user-friendly visual blueprints.
- Strengthen ability to plan screen flows before visual design begins.
- Understand the value of wireframes in the iterative design process.

## Guidelines for Wireframe Design

- Avoid using actual content/images — use placeholders.
- Use consistent spacing and alignment.
- Prioritize functionality and structure.
- Label buttons, inputs, and navigation clearly.
- Consider accessibility early on (e.g., font sizes, button spacing).
